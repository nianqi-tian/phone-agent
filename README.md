Phone Agent is a native iPhone AI assistant. It understands the screen you choose to share, then uses an ESP32-S3 Bluetooth mouse and keyboard accessory to move, click, and type.

> [!NOTE]
> This project currently provides development source code. Build and install the app with Xcode. Phone control requires an ESP32-S3 accessory, pointer calibration, full screen sharing, and a model that accepts images.

## Demo

Ask Phone Agent to open Meituan and find a Mixue lemon drink. These GIFs show each stage of the same iPhone recording at its original speed, with the action window visible during execution.

The recording ends at order review, before payment. Location and account balance are blurred; the published clips are silent.

## Features

**Phone control** — Observe the screen, generate an action, execute it, and observe the result. Queue tasks, pause or stop execution, take over manually, and add instructions during a task.

**Conversations** — Chat using text, dictation, shared screen images, or the camera. A separate configuration is available for real-time voice conversations.

**Files and tools** — Web search, memory, file and recording management, meeting notes, fishbone diagrams, and spreadsheets.

**System integration** — Siri and Shortcuts, Live Activities, and an action status window using Picture in Picture. Built with SwiftUI Liquid Glass, with light and dark appearances.

**Bluetooth accessory** — Mouse input, an ASCII keyboard, shortcuts, and pointer calibration in 21 steps. The GPIO48 RGB LED shows connection and task status: blue when disconnected, white when idle, rainbow during execution, red on failure, and green on completion.

## Requirements

- An iPhone running iOS 27.
- An ESP32-S3 development board and a USB data cable. The default firmware configuration uses 4 MB flash and a WS2812 RGB LED on GPIO48.
- An OpenAI-compatible model endpoint that accepts images, and your own API key.
- AssistiveTouch enabled, with accessory pairing, pointer calibration, and screen sharing completed.
- A Mac and Xcode 27 to build the app. Select your signing team for both targets when installing on an iPhone.
- ESP-IDF 5.5.4 to build the firmware.

## Install

1. Clone the repository and open the Xcode project:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/boboabw/phone-agent.git
   cd phone-agent
   open PhoneAgent.xcodeproj
   ```

2. Select your signing team for the `PhoneAgent` and `PhoneAgentActivity` targets. Choose your iPhone, then build and run.
3. In a terminal with ESP-IDF activated, run `bash scripts/build-firmware.sh`. Follow the [firmware guide](docs/firmware.md) to flash the ESP32-S3.
4. In the app's model connection settings, enter your provider name, complete HTTPS endpoint URL, model ID, and API key. Confirm the data sharing consent.
5. Pair `AgentMouse-S3` in the system AssistiveTouch settings. Connect in the app and complete pointer calibration. Start full screen sharing, enter a task, and begin execution.

See [Setup and Usage](docs/setup.md) for detailed instructions.

## Project Structure

[GestaltEdit](https://github.com/frs0n/GestaltEdit) served as a reference for Swift source organization and README layout.

The Swift app separates its entry point, interface, coordination, services, and local storage. Shared models and the Live Activity extension live alongside the app; ESP32-S3 firmware has its own ESP-IDF project.

### Module Responsibilities

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| App and coordination | `PhoneAgentApp` creates shared state. `ContentView` presents the workspace. `PhoneAgentViewModel` connects user input, task execution, queue state, and services. |
| Views and appearance | SwiftUI pages present state and route user actions to the coordinator or services. `Appearance` centralizes light and dark themes, glass surfaces, and transitions. |
| Phone control | `AgentEngine` coordinates `CaptureService`, `VisionClient`, and `MouseExecutor`. `BLETransport` sends mouse and keyboard commands to the ESP32-S3. |
| Conversations and tools | Services handle assistant conversations, voice, camera input, web research, system actions, and file processing. Corresponding views provide their interfaces. |
| Local storage | Stores manage settings, task history and queues, memory, recordings, and service preferences. API credentials use the Keychain. |
| Shared types | `Shared` defines action, protocol, and feature data models. Live Activity attributes and controls are also compiled into the extension. |
| System surfaces | `Activity` renders Live Activities and Dynamic Island content. App services manage Activity updates, Picture in Picture, Siri, and Shortcuts. |
| Control instructions | `Skills` contains bundled instructions loaded by `PhoneControlSkill` for the visual phone control loop. |
| Accessory firmware | `firmware/main` implements BLE services, HID reports, command execution, and RGB status feedback for the ESP32-S3. |

### Where to Make Changes

- Add or update a screen in `PhoneAgent/Views`; use `Appearance` for shared styling.
- Add service behavior in `PhoneAgent/Services`, persistent state in `Stores`, and reusable data types in `Shared`.
- Update phone control rules in `Skills` and accessory commands in `Shared/MouseProtocol.swift` together with the firmware.
- Keep extension UI in `Activity`; shared extension types belong in `Shared` with the appropriate target membership.

Xcode uses synchronized source folders. Swift files inside those folders are included automatically, subject to target membership exceptions. `Skills` is explicitly bundled as a folder resource. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the execution flow and detailed component boundaries.

## Data and Runtime

API keys are stored in the iPhone Keychain. Tasks, memory, recordings, and files are stored locally. Shared screen images, task text, and relevant context are sent to your configured model service after the required consent.

Voice, Siri, Picture in Picture, BLE, and execution across apps require verification on an actual iPhone. Background execution is subject to iOS scheduling. Continuous listening for a wake word is not implemented. See [Verification](docs/verification.md) for build and offline check records.
